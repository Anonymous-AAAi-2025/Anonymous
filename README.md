aaai 2025 anonymous code

This repo is an anonymous repository for an AAAI 2025 paper.

## TODO
Since the code is quite messy, we are still organizing it and will gradually open source the code.

## Dataset
We used the [PATS](https://chahuja.com/pats/download.html) dataset; for detailed steps, refer to the data processing of [S2G-MDDiffusion](https://github.com/thuhcsi/S2G-MDDiffusion/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#-data-preparation
).
